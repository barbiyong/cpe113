This is project for cpe113. Project Scheduling System

Project Scheduling System: Your program will allow the user to enter a set of tasks, each of which will have an estimated duration, plus dependencies between tasks (for example, you cannot start Task 2 until Task 1 is complete). The project task information should be read from and written to a file, so that it will be persistent between runs of the program. The program should also store information about the calendar (number of days per month, week days versus weekends). The user can then specify a start date for the project, and the program will calculate the project end date (the date all the tasks in the project will be completed). If you want to make the project more interesting, you can assign tasks to different people, so that some of the tasks could be worked on in parallel.
